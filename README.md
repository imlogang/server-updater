# server-updater
---
This repository serves as a way for my Discord bot to listen to [Patchbot](https://patchbot.io/) messages in a given Discord channel and trigger a restart or reinstall on a [Pterodactyl server](https://pterodactyl.io/) install. 

This can also send a message to the server of choice (i.e. It can post in a Minecraft server that it's going to update the server soon), as well as post in a specific Discord channel via a webhook.
